# reddit
build a gallery of pictures from reddit using the following API - reddit.js

The gallery will render images from a specific subreddit - example www.reddit.com/r/cats

·  The user interface must include an input field in order to define the subreddit(I've attached an example)

·  Hovering the mouse on a picture displays the post title

·  Click on image navigates to the actual reddit post in a new tab

·  Use AngularJS, Bootstrap and CSS3

·  Upload your project to GitHub

·  (Bonus) Build a pagination mechanism - add next and previous buttons that navigate between pages


things to be improved :
make a conifg.js file and put all the const there
seperate the script from script.js to diffrent script page. for the route for examlple i would use a seperate file to hold it.
maybe the route would come for db source or json file
the same rule for the directives , config and so on.
the pager i would put in directive as well.
i would use the UI-View instead of the ng-route i used.
fix the breaking line in the images on the grid.
